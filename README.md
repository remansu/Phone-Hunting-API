# Phone-Hunting-API

Project Setup:
Created a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Organized project files into index.html, styles.css, script.js, and an assets folder for images and additional resources.
Ensured responsive design for compatibility across devices.
Key Functionalities Implemented
1. User Interface (UI) Design
Designed a visually appealing UI with clear and easy-to-navigate components using CSS.
Used card components to display default phone information for a quick overview.
Employed CSS transitions and animations to improve user interaction and feedback.
2. Search Functionality
Implemented search functionality using JavaScript.
Captured user input and filtered phone details based on the input.
Used Array.filter() to match search terms with phone names or models, ensuring relevant results are displayed.
Provided real-time feedback by updating the card display based on search results.
3. Detailed Information Display on Card Click
Added an onclick event listener to each phone card to display detailed information.
Created a modal pop-up to show additional phone details when a user clicks on a phone card.
Utilized JavaScript to populate the modal with detailed data from an object containing phone details.
4. Detailed Information on Search
Enhanced the search functionality to display detailed information directly on the phone card for matching results.
Combined the search functionality with the detail display, so relevant details are visible without additional clicks after a search.
5. "Show All" Button Functionality
Added a "Show All" button to display the complete list of phones and their details.
Used an event listener to load all phone cards with details when this button is clicked.
Optimized performance to prevent reloading data multiple times by checking if the cards are already displayed.
6. Video Explanation
Created a video walkthrough of the project.
Demonstrated the search functionality, card clicks, detailed view, "Show All" button, and overall navigation.
Explained how each feature improves the user experience and how JavaScript functionalities were implemented.
